# ta-toolbox

This is a collection of tools that I have written while working as a TA for CMSC330 at the University of Maryland.  A lot of them are related to Gradescope, since there was a lot of functionality that I needed that just isn't there yet.

Some of this may become outdated and cease to work.  If this happens, feel free to submit an issue, PR, or email me at [vinnie@vcaprarola.me](mailto:vinnie@vcaprarola.me) if this happens and I will try to fix it.

The tools in this repository are listed below:

## project-grades

Use this for computing project grades because Gradescope can't do stuff like extensions, late penalties, etc.

## rosters

Use this for formatting the UMEG course roster(s) into more useful and readable formats.

## gradescope-grading-stats

Track TA's grading progress on Gradescope online assignments and exams.

## autograder-images

This repository contains base Docker images for setting up projects (Ruby, OCaml, Rust) for the Gradescope Autograder, and some example project setups.

## swipe-attendance

Take attendance more easily during exams by swiping the ID cards.

## tutorials

A general list of useful how-tos that don't necessarily require any additional tools, but may not be intuitive or straightforward.
